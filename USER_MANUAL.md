## Search Functionality

Search allows you to find files quickly by filename or by text content inside PDF documents.

### Understanding Search

**What Can You Search?**
- ‚úÖ File names (exact and partial matches)
- ‚úÖ Folder names (when "File/Folder names" filter is enabled)
- ‚úÖ PDF text content (full-text search)
- ‚ùå File metadata (not in current version)

**How Search Works:**
1. When you upload a PDF, text is automatically extracted
2. Text content is stored in the database
3. Search queries match against both filename and content
4. Results are returned instantly

### Using the Search Feature

#### Basic Search

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Open a Data Room**
   - Search works within a specific Data Room
   - Navigate to the Data Room you want to search

2. **Locate the Search Box**
   - Usually in the top toolbar
   - Has a magnifying glass icon üîç
   - Placeholder text: "Search files..."

3. **Configure Search Filters (Optional)**
   - Click the filter icon next to the search box
   - A collapsible panel will appear showing search options:
     - **File/Folder names**: Search in filenames and folder names
     - **File content**: Search in PDF text content
   - By default, both options are enabled
   - You can uncheck one to narrow your search:
     - Uncheck "File content" to search only by name
     - Uncheck "File/Folder names" to search only in content
   - At least one option must be selected

4. **Enter Your Query**
   - Type your search term
   - Example: "contract", "2025", "John Smith"
   - Search is case-insensitive

5. **Execute Search**
   - Press Enter or click the search button
   - Search runs against current Data Room only
   - Uses the selected filter options

6. **View Results**
   - Results appear in the main area
   - Shows matching files and folders
   - Indicates match type based on your filters:
     - "Filename match" - found in file/folder name
     - "Content match" - found in PDF content
     - "Filename & Content match" - found in both

#### Search Filters

**Filter Options:**

The search filter panel gives you precise control over where to search:

1. **File/Folder Names Only**
   - Use when you remember part of the filename
   - Faster results (no content scanning needed)
   - Example: Search "contract-2025" to find files with that name pattern
   - Includes folder names in results

2. **File Content Only**
   - Use when searching for specific text inside PDFs
   - Finds documents containing your search terms
   - Example: Search "John Smith" to find all contracts mentioning that person
   - Useful for finding documents by content rather than name

3. **Both (Default)**
   - Most comprehensive search
   - Finds matches in either filenames or content
   - Recommended for general searches
   - Results show where the match was found

#### Search Results

**Result Display:**
- File name
- File size
- Location (folder path)
- Match type: "Filename match" or "Content match"
- Upload date
- Action buttons (Download, Open location)

**No Results:**
- Message: "No files found matching 'your query'"
- Try different keywords
- Check spelling
- Try broader terms

### Advanced Search Tips

**Best Practices:**

1. **Use Search Filters Strategically**
   - When you know the filename: Disable "File content" for faster results
   - When searching for concepts: Disable "File/Folder names" to focus on content
   - When unsure: Keep both enabled (default)

2. **Use Specific Terms**
   - ‚úÖ "acquisition agreement" (specific)
   - ‚ùå "document" (too broad)

3. **Try Variations**
   - If "contract" doesn't work, try "agreement" or "terms"
   - Use synonyms

4. **Partial Matches**
   - "2025" will match "Report_2025.pdf"
   - "Smith" will match "John_Smith_Contract.pdf"

5. **Multi-word Queries**
   - Current version: Searches for files containing the entire phrase
   - Future: Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT)

6. **Case-Insensitive**
   - "CONTRACT" and "contract" return the same results

**Common Search Patterns:**

| What You Want | Search Query | Recommended Filter |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| All 2025 files | `2025` | File/Folder names only |
| Contracts | `contract` or `agreement` | Both (default) |
| Files by person | `John Smith` | File content only |
| Financial docs | `financial` or `statement` | Both (default) |
| Specific term | `"due diligence"` | File content only |
| Files with naming pattern | `report_Q4` | File/Folder names only |

### Search Limitations

**Current Version:**
- Searches one Data Room at a time (not global)
- No fuzzy matching (exact substring match)
- No ranking by relevance
- Limited filters (name vs content only)

**Planned Enhancements:**
- Global search across all Data Rooms
- Fuzzy matching and typo tolerance
- Advanced filters (by date, size, folder)
- Search result ranking
- Search history

### PDF Text Extraction

**How It Works:**
- When you upload a PDF, the server uses PyPDF2 to extract text
- Text is stored in the `content_text` field
- This enables content search

**Limitations:**
- Scanned PDFs without OCR may have no extractable text
- Image-based PDFs won't be searchable by content
- Complex layouts may have garbled text extraction

**Tip:** If a PDF isn't searchable, ensure it's text-based (not a scanned image).

```
[Number] [Category]
Example: "01 Financial Documents"
         "02 Legal Agreements"
         "03 Technical Specifications"
```

**For Files:**
```
[Date]_[Type]_[Description]_[Version]
Example: "2025-10-15_Contract_Employment_v1.pdf"
         "2025-Q4_Report_Financial_FINAL.pdf"
```

#### 3. Access Control Strategy

**Current Version:**
- Each user can only see their own Data Rooms
- No sharing functionality yet

**Planning for Future Sharing:**
- Create clear ownership structure
- Document who should have access
- Keep sensitive documents in separate Data Rooms

### File Management Tips

#### Versioning Strategy

Since the app doesn't have built-in versioning:

**Filename Versioning:**
```
Contract_v1.pdf
Contract_v2.pdf
Contract_v3_FINAL.pdf
Contract_v3_FINAL_FINAL.pdf (avoid this!)
```

**Better Approach:**
```
2025-10-15_Contract_Draft.pdf
2025-10-20_Contract_Review.pdf
2025-10-22_Contract_Final.pdf
```

**Version Control Folder:**
```
Contracts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Employment_Contract_v3.pdf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Archive/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Employment_Contract_v1.pdf
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Employment_Contract_v2.pdf
```

#### Backup Strategy

**Regular Backups:**
1. Download critical files weekly
2. Store backups in multiple locations
3. Use external hard drives or cloud storage
4. Test restore process periodically

**Before Major Changes:**
- Download all files before restructuring
- Keep old structure until new one is validated
- Document changes made

### Search Optimization

**Making Files More Searchable:**

1. **Use Descriptive Filenames**
   - ‚úÖ "2025_Tax_Return_Federal.pdf"
   - ‚ùå "Document1.pdf"

2. **Include Keywords in Filename**
   - Include names, dates, types
   - Example: "Smith_John_Employment_Agreement_2025.pdf"

3. **Ensure PDFs Have Text**
   - Use text-based PDFs, not scanned images
   - If you have scans, use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) before uploading

4. **Consistent Terminology**
   - Choose one term and stick with it
   - "Agreement" vs "Contract" ‚Äì pick one
   - "Q1" vs "First Quarter" ‚Äì be consistent

### Performance Tips

**For Large Data Rooms:**

1. **Limit Folder Depth**
   - Keep nesting to 4-5 levels maximum
   - Deep nesting makes navigation harder

2. **Split Large Files**
   - If a PDF is near 100MB, consider splitting it
   - Smaller files upload and download faster

3. **Regular Cleanup**
   - Delete outdated files
   - Archive old versions
   - Remove duplicates

4. **Batch Operations**
   - Upload multiple files at once (if supported)
   - Organize folders before uploading
